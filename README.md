Project Description:
For this project, I create a web format resume. On my web page, it starts with an introduction section, then my experience, skills, previous projects, and contact info at the end. I also added a navigation bar on the left side with an interesting hover effect on the profile icon. The web page is fully responsive and all the images are clickable (Images created myself, no copyright issue involved). I have fully demonstrated my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and sincerely hope all visitors will enjoy it.
